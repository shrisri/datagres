<h1>Program 5</h1>
<h2><p>Create a master script that will spawn Program 1 for many files, under many directores, and run the complete test using program 2 and program 3, and program 4, and finally come and tell whether all the verification succeeded or not, if not, which file under which directory has the problem.</p></h2>

<h2><p>This program consists of a master script that calls all the programs including the one that enters data as well different forms of verification one by one and performs the check as to which file has the Failure.</p></h2>
<h2><p>Instructions: To run this program type in 'make files=' followed by 2 file arguments that you wish to include in quotes.For eg: make files="newfile.txt testfile.txt" .It will first write to one of the files and store char,size,offset in newfile2.txt.The first test that it will run will output its results into results3.txt.The second test is test3.sh which will append results into results2.txt.And the third test is test4.sh which will verify in parts and append the results to a file called results.txt.It will repeat the same process for all the arguments passed, enter all the file names that have a failure into totalres.txt and display the files.</p></h2>
