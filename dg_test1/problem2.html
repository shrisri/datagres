<h1>Program 1</h1>
<h2><p>Create a file F1, writing random byte for a random size, starting from random offsets. store the offset, size, and the byte you wrote for different offsets in a file called as F2. Do this say 100, 1000 times or whatever.</p></h2>

<h2><p>Instructions: To compile this program only,open dg_test1 directory and type the command 'make test1'.This program is meant to generate random strings of random size and write them to different offsets into a file (newfile.txt). At the same time it also writes metadata in the form of char, size, offset to another file (newfile2.txt). The code ensures thats these files are created when they do not exist and are overwritten when they already exist. To compile program1-4 all together, type 'make'.</p></h2>
